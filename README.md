INSTRUCTIONS

Navigate to Builds and run Build.exe

To play the game, the following is good to know (using HTC VIVE):

Change between controlling the characters hands and feet using the trigger button. 
 
When using your feet:
Put them down on the ground in front of you and imagine pulling yourself forward to walk. 
Put them down on the ground and hold down the grip button. Upon release, the character will jump. 
In order to jump in a certain direction, momentum must first be generated by pulling yourself forward and then timing the jump.

When using your hands:
Use the grip button to grab on to the climbing rocks. 

Pressing spacebar will restart the level. 
Pressing keys 1, 2, or 3 will teleport the player to the respective checkpoints.
